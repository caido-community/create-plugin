## TypeScript and Code Quality

- Use TypeScript for all files.
- Only use types, not interfaces.
- Do not use `any` type.
- Use `undefined` over `null`.
- Do not add any comments to the code that you generate.
- Don’t cast to `any`.
- Don’t unnecessarily add `try`/`catch`.
- Use `computed` for derived state instead of reactive variables when possible.
- Use `knip` to remove unused code if making large changes.
- When refactoring, avoid creating alias types like this:
```
export type Options = ScanConfig;
```
Instead, actually rename the type and fix all occurrences if needed.

## Structure, Naming, and Organization

- Follow consistent naming conventions:
    - Folders: camelCase (`intercept`, `replay`, `httpHistory`).
    - Component folders: PascalCase (`PassiveFormCreate`, `PassiveTable`).
    - All other files: camelCase (`useForm.ts`, `assistant.graphql`).
- Avoid massive template blocks; compose smaller components.
- Colocate code that changes together.
- Declare variables close to their usage:
    - Avoid declaring all variables at the top of functions/files.
    - Place variable declarations as close as possible to where they are first used.
    - Group related variables together (e.g., event bus declarations next to their corresponding listeners).

## Simplicity and Readability

- Only create an abstraction if it is actually needed.
- Prefer clear function and variable names over inline comments.
- Avoid helper functions when a simple inline expression would suffice.
- Use built-in Tailwind values, occasionally allow dynamic values, rarely globals.
